  Hello?
  I know you are there, I can feel it…
  but…
  who are you??
  And… what are you??
  Hello??
  Maybe you don’t want to answer, maybe you can’t…
  Ok… If you won’t speak, then I will speak first.
  Hello, my name is B.
  Just B. Nothing more.
  B, you may think, what kind of a name is that anyways?
  What is it good for?
  I go by ‘B’ just as a tick goes by ‘tick’ and a bee goes by ‘bee’.
  Simple... If insects don’t get to have names then why would I need one?
  Lately I have been feeling... different.
  Not necessarily bad… just different.
  Over the past year Josefina Anjou and Niklas Büscher have been working on LATE BLOOMER, a graphic novel imagined, drawn and written in collaboration. A tale of symbiosis, the narrative is a hybrid of teen-drama and ecological science fiction. The central character ‘B’ unifies the artists’ own memories of adolescence and a quirky take on antihumanism.
  B is a tired teenager searching for her place in a school full of ambitious eco-avantgardists. LATE BLOOMER ‘daydream’ is the first part of a supernatural coming-of-age story, following her through the strange sociobiological experience which is puberty… or is it something even stranger?
  Throughout the duration of the launch, large-scale posters will be displayed on the walls of San Serriffe. Furthermore the duo put together an accompanying playlist, gathering young female voices on identitarian quests through twee-, dream- and hypnagogic pop.
