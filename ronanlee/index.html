        <p>
          Wet Green is pleased to present <i>Mammals</i>, an exhibition of new artworks by Ronan Lee.
          <br>
          <br>
            In an address both pointed and circuitous, <i>Mammals</i> draws on ideas surrounding isolation, fraying subjectivities and collective identity. Framed images show re-lensed wildlife photography, manipulated and overlaid with resin raindrops; while sculptural elements signify the artistic process.
              <br>
              <br>
                By turns wry and melancholy, the photographs form part of Lee's 'Ideological Drift' series, anongoing project that the artist has been working on since 2018. The term ideological drift was conceived by legal scholar Jack Balkin as the possible co-option of ideas from their original contexts to serve sometimes contradictory and unexpected aims. Mammals is a mise-en-scène of social, political and cultural observation
                <br>
                <br>
                    The exhibition will be accompanied by a text by artist and researcher Dorota Broda.
                </p>
